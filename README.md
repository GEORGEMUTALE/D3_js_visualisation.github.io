# D3.js Data Visualization 

## Introduction

This project is a simple introduction to using **D3.js** for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations on the web. D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to bind data to a webpage and create interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need a basic understanding of:

- **HTML** and **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics)

You also need a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox.

### Installation

To use D3.js in your project, you can include it in your HTML file through a CDN or install it via npm.

1. **CDN:**
   Add the following `<script>` tag to the `<head>` of your HTML file:
   
   ```html
   <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **NPM:**
   If you are using npm in your project, you can install D3.js by running:

   ```bash
   npm install d3
   ```

### Customization

You can easily modify the chart by:

- Changing the dataset.
- Adjusting the size and color of the bars.
- Adding axis labels, legends, tooltips, etc.
